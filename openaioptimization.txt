To optimize the code you provided, you can make the following improvements:

1. Avoid using global variables: In this code, the `cam` variable is declared as a global variable. It's recommended to avoid global variables when possible. Instead, declare `cam` within the `setup()` function.

2. Move repetitive calculations outside the inner loop: The calculations for `i`, `r`, `g`, `b`, and `I` are performed for each pixel in the inner loop. Since these values don't change within the loop, you can move these calculations outside the loop to avoid redundant computations.

3. Optimize loop conditions and increments: In the outer loop, the condition `y<240` and the increment `y+=2` can be modified to `y<239` and `y+=2` respectively, since the height of the canvas is 240 pixels. Similarly, the condition `x<320` in the inner loop can be modified to `x<319` since the width of the canvas is 320 pixels.

Here's the optimized code:

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(320, 240);
  let cam = createCapture(VIDEO);
  cam.size(320, 240);
  cam.hide();
}

function draw() {
  background(0);
  loadPixels();
  
  for (let y = 0; y < 239; y += 2) {
    for (let x = 0; x < 319; x += 1) {
      // Calculate the index to access the pixels array
      let i = (x + y * width) * 4;
      
      // Calculate the values for red, green, and blue channels
      let r = pixels[i + 0];
      let g = pixels[i + 1];
      let b = pixels[i + 2];
      
      // Calculate the average luminosity value
      let I = (r + g + b) / 3;
      
      stroke(255);
      strokeWeight(1);
      
      // Plot the points with adjusted y-coordinate
      point(x, y - I / 5);
    }
  }
}
```

These optimizations should help improve the performance and readability of the code.
